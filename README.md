# DDPM_DatasetFeatures

This is the official repository of the thesis: ASSESSING SPARSE IMAGE DATASETS FOR GENERATIVE MODELING: A FEATURE-DRIVEN APPROACH.

To start, clone the repository and download the remaining data (datasets and model weights) from one of the following link:

- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHagoStazQKI0CnL_6bMyCVYTRhco7a1/view?usp=drive_link

Unzip the data into the working directory, and install the requirements based on the requirements.txt file.
