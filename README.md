# DDPM_DatasetFeatures

This is the official repository of the thesis: ASSESSING SPARSE IMAGE DATASETS FOR GENERATIVE MODELING: A FEATURE-DRIVEN APPROACH.

To start, clone the repository and download the remaining data (datasets and model weights) from one of the following link:

- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHagoStazQKI0CnL_6bMyCVYTRhco7a1/view?usp=drive_link

Unzip the data into the working directory, and install the requirements based on the requirements.txt file.

To apply the dataset assessment framework on unseen data, put your datasets into the "test_data" folder. It is important to keep following folder structure: ./test_data/img/
Obama and LSUNBed are already placed in the test folder as examples.

```python
  !python Main.py --apply_framework True
```
